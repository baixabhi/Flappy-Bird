# Flappy-Bird
Explore the world of game development with my Flappy Bird clone implemented in Python using the Pygame library. This project replicates the classic Flappy Bird game, challenging players to navigate a bird through a series of pipes by tapping the spacebar. The game features a welcome screen, scoring system, and obstacles that increase in difficulty. Dive into the code to understand the mechanics of game development and Pygame usage. This project is a great starting point for those interested in learning about game programming and Python.
